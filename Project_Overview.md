Self Driving Car built for AWS DeepRacer competition

### What is AWS DeepRacer?
<em> AWS DeepRacer is an integrated learning system for users of all levels to learn and explore reinforcement learning and to experiment and build autonomous driving applications. It consists of the following components:

An AWS Machine Learning service to train and evaluate reinforcement learning models in a simulated autonomous-driving environment.

AWS DeepRacer 1/18th scale RC vehicles capable of running inference on a trained AWS DeepRacer model for autonomous driving.

AWS DeepRacer for the participants to compete on model performances on a specific track in a simulated or real environment and have the results ranked on a virtual or physical leader board. </em>

To build the model and compete two main AWS services were used:

<strong>AWS Robomaker</strong>.
